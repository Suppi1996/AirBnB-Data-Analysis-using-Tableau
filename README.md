### Story: Navigating the Airbnb Market with Data-Driven Insights

Hello,  
🌟 Today, we’re embarking on a journey through the Airbnb market using data insights visualized on our Tableau dashboard. 
Think of this dashboard as a map to the key factors that drive success on Airbnb — from ideal pricing strategies to seasonal trends. This journey is built on real data from Airbnb listings

### Step 1: Exploring the Dataset’s Potential 🚀

Our journey begins with selecting the right data. We’ll be working with the Airbnb dataset from Kaggle, which offers a wealth of information. Here’s how to get started with Tableau Public:

Download the dataset from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alexanderfreberg/airbnb-listings-2016-dataset.
Open Tableau Public and connect to the data source (Excel format).

### Step 2: Merging Data for Deeper Insights 🧠

To unlock richer insights, we’ll combine the ‘Listing’ and ‘Calendar’ tables for a comprehensive view:

Navigate to the ‘Data’ section and Open the Listing and add Calendar based on Inner join.
Link the tables using the Listing ID to unify data points.

### Step 3: Creating Visualizations That Tell a Story 🎨

#### Chapter 1: AvgPrice by Zip Code 🌍

Our first stop is the *AvgPrice by Zip Code* chart, which showcases different ZipCodes’ average pricing. 
This visualization is like a bar chart of potential income: higher-priced zones show where demand allows for premium rates. For hosts, targeting these zones can mean capitalizing on lucrative market opportunities.

### Chapter 2: Riding the Seasonal Wave 📅

Every Airbnb host knows that demand fluctuates with the seasons. The *Revenue Trends by Year (Line Chart)* paints this picture clearly, showing how revenue changes over time. 
You can pinpoint the months when guests spend the most, and plan your business strategies around these peaks. 
This insight is essential for adjusting nightly rates, running seasonal promotions, or even updating listings to highlight seasonal amenities.

### Chapter 3: Fine-Tuning the Room Mix 🛏️

In the *Average Price by Bedroom Count* chart, we dive into how the number of bedrooms affects pricing. If your property offers more rooms, this visualization confirms that you can set higher rates based on room count. The insights here help you understand the trade-off between space and price, allowing you to position your property competitively based on the bedroom count.

To go a step further, the *Bedroom Count Listings (Table)* reveals the competition for each bedroom count.

The Number of * Reviews per Zip Code*  heat map reveals the activity level in different areas, showing where Airbnb properties are most frequently reviewed. High review counts indicate popular or highly visited areas, suggesting a strong guest demand and potential for business growth.

This dashboard doesn’t just show raw numbers; it’s designed to help you make decisions with clarity. Use it to track performance, identify opportunities, and test out strategies with confidence.
